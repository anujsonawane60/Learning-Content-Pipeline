Course: Introduction to Web Development
Slug: intro-web-dev

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern web development.
You will learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the three
core technologies that power every website on the internet.

By the end of this course you will be able to build responsive web pages,
style them professionally, and add interactive behavior with JavaScript.

Module 1: HTML Fundamentals

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every web page.
In this module you will learn how to structure content using semantic HTML elements.

Chapter 1: What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language
used to create web pages. Every website you visit is built with HTML at its core.

A basic HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Key concepts:
- Tags are enclosed in angle brackets like <p> and </p>
- Most elements have an opening and closing tag
- The DOCTYPE declaration tells the browser which version of HTML to use
- The <head> section contains metadata; the <body> contains visible content

Chapter 2: Common HTML Elements

There are many HTML elements you will use frequently:

Headings range from <h1> (most important) to <h6> (least important).
Paragraphs use the <p> tag. Links use the <a> tag with an href attribute.

Lists come in two flavors:
- Unordered lists (<ul>) display bullet points
- Ordered lists (<ol>) display numbered items

Images are self-closing tags:
```html
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="A description of the photo">
```

Tables organize data in rows and columns using <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>.

Chapter 3: Forms and Input

Forms allow users to submit data to a server. They are essential for login pages,
search bars, registration forms, and any interactive data collection.

A simple form example:
```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Common input types include: text, email, password, number, date, checkbox, and radio.

Module 2: CSS Styling

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual presentation of HTML elements.
Without CSS, web pages would be plain unstyled text. This module covers
selectors, properties, layout techniques, and responsive design.

Chapter 1: CSS Selectors and Properties

CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block:

```css
h1 {
    color: navy;
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

Types of selectors:
- Element selectors: h1, p, div
- Class selectors: .highlight, .card
- ID selectors: #main-header
- Descendant selectors: nav a
- Pseudo-classes: a:hover, li:first-child

Common properties include color, background, font-size, margin, padding,
border, display, and position.

Chapter 2: Flexbox and Grid Layout

Modern CSS provides two powerful layout systems:

Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns):
```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 1rem;
}
```

CSS Grid handles two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns):
```css
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 2rem;
}
```

Use Flexbox for navigation bars, card rows, and centering content.
Use Grid for full page layouts, image galleries, and dashboards.

Module 3: JavaScript Basics

JavaScript brings interactivity to web pages. It is the only programming
language that runs natively in web browsers. This module introduces
variables, functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

Chapter 1: Variables and Data Types

JavaScript has three ways to declare variables:

```javascript
var oldWay = "avoid this";      // function-scoped, legacy
let counter = 0;                // block-scoped, reassignable
const API_URL = "/api/data";    // block-scoped, not reassignable
```

Data types include:
- string: "hello"
- number: 42, 3.14
- boolean: true, false
- null and undefined
- object: { key: "value" }
- array: [1, 2, 3]

Chapter 2: Functions and Control Flow

Functions encapsulate reusable logic:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

Control flow statements:
- if / else if / else for conditional logic
- for and while loops for iteration
- switch for multiple branch selection
- try / catch for error handling
